### Linked Data Interactions Orchestrator (LDIO) 

The Linked Data Interactions Orchestrator is built to be a lightweight Linked Data pipeline framework.

For more detail on how to use the LDIO, please visit the [LDIO Documentation](https://openldes.github.io/Linked-Data-Interactions/ldio).

For that, a specially bundled NiFi Docker image is available.

Documentation on how to use the individual Processors can be found in the in-app documentation and on [the LDI NiFi docs](https://openldes.github.io/Linked-Data-Interactions/ldi-nifi).

## Which version should I use?

* As a general recommendation, the **official release** is the goto version to use. This is the ideal version to use on Production.
* The **alpha/snapshot versions** available on dockerhub provide a certain stability, but have not been internally validated on specification compliance. These versions can be used for non-production environments (test/acceptance/...)
* The images found on **GitHub** itself should not be used for anything other than testing, they are prone to changes and do not come with any support.
